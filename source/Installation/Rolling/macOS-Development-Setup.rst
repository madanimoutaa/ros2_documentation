System requirements
-------------------

We support macOS 10.14 (Mojave).

However, some new versions like 10.13.x and some older versions like 10.11.x and 10.10.x are known to work as well.

Install prerequisites
---------------------

You need the following things installed to build ROS 2:


#.
   **Xcode**


   *
     If you don't already have it installed, install Xcode and the Command Line Tools:

     .. code-block:: bash

        xcode-select --install
        sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer

#.
   **brew** *(needed to install more stuff; you probably already have this)*:


   * Follow installation instructions at http://brew.sh/
   *
     *Optional*: Check that ``brew`` is happy with your system configuration by running:

     .. code-block:: bash

        brew doctor

     Fix any problems that it identifies.

#.
   Use ``brew`` to install more stuff:

   .. code-block:: bash

       brew install cmake cppcheck eigen pcre poco tinyxml wget bullet

       brew install python@3.8
       brew unlink python
       # Make the python command be Python 3.8
       brew link --force python@3.8

       # install dependencies for Fast-RTPS if you are using it
       brew install asio tinyxml2

       brew install opencv

       # install console_bridge for rosbag2
       brew install console_bridge

       # install OpenSSL for DDS-Security
       brew install openssl
       # if you are using ZSH, then replace '.bashrc' with '.zshrc'
       echo "export OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=$(brew --prefix openssl)" >> ~/.bashrc

       # install dependencies for rcl_logging
       brew install log4cxx spdlog

       # install CUnit for Cyclone DDS
       brew install cunit

#.
   Install rviz dependencies

   .. code-block:: bash

       # install dependencies for Rviz
       brew install qt freetype assimp

       # Add the Qt directory to the PATH and CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
       export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH:/usr/local/opt/qt
       export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/opt/qt/bin

#.
   Install rqt dependencies

  ``brew install graphviz pyqt5 sip``

  Fix some path names when looking for sip stuff during install (see `ROS 1 wiki <http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/OSX/Homebrew/Source#Qt_naming_issue>`__):

  ``ln -s /usr/local/share/sip/Qt5 /usr/local/share/sip/PyQt5``

#.
   Use ``python3 -m pip`` (just ``pip`` may install Python3 or Python2) to install more stuff:

   .. code-block:: bash

       python3 -m pip install -U argcomplete catkin_pkg colcon-common-extensions coverage cryptography empy flake8 flake8-blind-except flake8-builtins flake8-class-newline flake8-comprehensions flake8-deprecated flake8-docstrings flake8-import-order flake8-quotes ifcfg lark-parser lxml mock mypy netifaces nose pep8 pydocstyle pydot pygraphviz pyparsing pytest-mock rosdep setuptools vcstool

   Please ensure that the ``$PATH`` environment variable contains the install location of the binaries (default: ``$HOME/Library/Python/<version>/bin``)

#.
   *Optional*: if you want to build the ROS 1<->2 bridge, then you must also install ROS 1:


   * Start with the normal install instructions: http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/OSX/Homebrew/Source
   *
     When you get to the step where you call ``rosinstall_generator`` to get the source code, here's an alternate invocation that brings in just the minimum required to produce a useful bridge:

     .. code-block:: bash

          rosinstall_generator catkin common_msgs roscpp rosmsg --rosdistro kinetic --deps --wet-only --tar > kinetic-ros2-bridge-deps.rosinstall
          wstool init -j8 src kinetic-ros2-bridge-deps.rosinstall


     Otherwise, just follow the normal instructions, then source the resulting ``install_isolated/setup.bash`` before proceeding here to build ROS 2.

Disable System Integrity Protection (SIP)
-----------------------------------------

macOS/OS X versions >=10.11 have System Integrity Protection enabled by default.
So that SIP doesn't prevent processes from inheriting dynamic linker environment variables, such as ``DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH``, you'll need to disable it `following these instructions <https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Security/Conceptual/System_Integrity_Protection_Guide/ConfiguringSystemIntegrityProtection/ConfiguringSystemIntegrityProtection.html>`__.

Get the ROS 2 code
------------------

Create a workspace and clone all repos:

.. code-block:: bash

   mkdir -p ~/ros2_foxy/src
   cd ~/ros2_foxy
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros2/ros2/foxy/ros2.repos
   vcs import src < ros2.repos

Install additional DDS vendors (optional)
-----------------------------------------

If you would like to use another DDS or RTPS vendor besides the default, eProsima's Fast RTPS, you can find instructions `here <../DDS-Implementations>`.

Build the ROS 2 code
--------------------

**Note**\ : if you are trying to build the ROS 1 <-> ROS 2 bridge, follow instead these `modified instructions <https://github.com/ros2/ros1_bridge/blob/master/README#build-the-bridge-from-source>`__.

Run the ``colcon`` tool to build everything (more on using ``colcon`` in `this tutorial </Tutorials/Colcon-Tutorial>`):

.. code-block:: bash

   cd ~/ros2_foxy/
   colcon build --symlink-install

Environment setup
-----------------

Source the ROS 2 setup file:

.. code-block:: bash

   . ~/ros2_foxy/install/setup.bash

This will automatically set up the environment for any DDS vendors that support was built for.

Try some examples
-----------------

In one terminal, set up the ROS 2 environment as described above and then run a C++ ``talker``:

.. code-block:: bash

   ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker

In another terminal source the setup file and then run a Python ``listener``:

.. code-block:: bash

   ros2 run demo_nodes_py listener

You should see the ``talker`` saying that it's ``Publishing`` messages and the ``listener`` saying ``I heard`` those messages.
This verifies both the C++ and Python APIs are working properly.
Hooray!

See the `tutorials and demos </Tutorials>` for other things to try.

Stay up to date
---------------

See :ref:`MaintainingSource` to periodically refresh your source installation.

Troubleshooting
---------------

Troubleshooting techniques can be found :ref:`here <macOS-troubleshooting>`.

Uninstall
---------

1. If you installed your workspace with colcon as instructed above, "uninstalling" could be just a matter of opening a new terminal and not sourcing the workspace's ``setup`` file.
   This way, your environment will behave as though there is no Foxy install on your system.

2. If you're also trying to free up space, you can delete the entire workspace directory with:

   .. code-block:: bash

    rm -rf ~/ros2_foxy
